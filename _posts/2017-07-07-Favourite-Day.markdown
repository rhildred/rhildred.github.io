Students had 3 hours to put together a website with a subtheme and a simple shortcode plugin. They all had to do the site on the topic of their favourite day. As well as the subtheme the rubric included some iframe type things like a Google map and Calendar. Generally they found this fun and engaging. I picked this particular site for the writing style.
