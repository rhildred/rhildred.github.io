##Required Text

**Specification By Example: How Successful Teams Deliver the Right Software**, Gojko Adzic, June 2011 ISBN 9781617290084, Manning 

##Course Overview

The objective of this course is to familiarize students with software application development processes and underlying concepts. Topics covered include object oriented analysis and design, software development life cycles, models and methodologies, quality assurance and improvement, and the basics of tools used for application development such as requirement management tools, version control, and defect tracking.

Coverage of each topic will be at an introductory level, with the starting assumption that students have no existing knowledge in that area. This course will give students the confidence to discuss software development process intelligently with others, and to solve basic software problems as part of a team.

##Class Format

The course will be held in the interactive classroom. Students will participate in groups in various software development activities, after having a demonstration by the instructor.

##Attendance Expectations

In registering for MB215 you have committed to the scheduled class times. My expectation is that you will attend every class. The lectures and activities will sometimes be based on the textbook, but not always. The activities will often be based in content delivered during the preceding activities. If you miss a class you may be unable to complete the associated activities

Information will often be given in class about upcoming classes, test information, and project information. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find a fellow student who is willing to update you on what content was covered and information provided. I do not provide lecture notes, summaries, or updates to students who have missed classes.

You are expected to be in class, but I understand that situations, such as illness or a death in the family, do arise. If you are going to miss class, please email me or tell me in advance.

##Evaluation

|Item|due|percentage|
|---|---|---|
|Project 1 - Java Game|January 29|15%|
|Midterm|Feb 24 in class|25%|
|Project 2 - Java Web App|April 1st|25%|
|Final|To Be Scheduled|35%|

##Mid-term Examination

The mid-term examination will be held on Wednesday, February 24th during class time. It will cover all material up to software development models and methodologies (expected to be material covered by start of reading week).

The mid-term examination will not be offered at any other time. If you miss the mid-term for health or bereavement reasons you must provide appropriate documentation as per the academic calendar. If appropriate documentation is provided, the weighting of the final examination will be increased to 55% in consideration of the missed mid-term. If the mid-term is missed for any other reason, a mark of 0 will be given.

##Final Examination

The final exam will cover all of the material in the course. The final exam will be held during the final exam period, Apr 7 - Apr 23, 2016, and will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office. You are expected to be available during the entire exam period. If you have more than one exam scheduled for the same time, or if you have three or more exams scheduled to start and end within a 24-hour period, the university will defer one of your exams to Slip Day. The university chooses which exam will be deferred. No other alternate arrangements will be made for exams. If you miss an exam for any reason, including weather, health issues, or a death in the family, you will be required to submit a petition to the Brantford Faculty Petitions Committee in order to write the exam at a later date. If your petition is successful, the exam will be written at some point during the two following semesters.

For complete university policy and procedure information regarding final examinations please see the Undergraduate Academic Calendar.

##MyLearningSpace

The course has a MyLearningSpace area. It will be used for posting the course outline, assignments, groups, etc, as well as any announcements such as new or revised readings or class cancellations. Written assignments will be submitted through MyLearningSpace, and grades will be posted there as well.

**Do not email me through MyLearningSpace.** Emails sent through MyLearningSpace do not go to the recipient's Laurier email account, and I cannot guarantee that I will check MyLearningSpace regularly.

##Contacting the Instructor

The best option for contacting me is to drop by my office or to set up an appointment, between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm Wednesdays and Fridays. I am always happy to meet with you if you have questions or concerns.

Do not expect responses to email on the weekends or after 5:00 pm during the week. If you have questions about assignments or the exam, you need to be organized enough that you can ask them during regular business hours.

##Electronic Hardware Policy

All cell phones, smartphones (Blackberries/iPhones/Android) etc. must be turned off during class. Please ensure that your devices are off and not on vibrate or ring to avoid distracting other members of the class. Also be aware that some of these devices cause static in some of the campus lecture hall speaker systems so it is important to ensure that they are off and not just on stand-by. This policy has also been set due to the distracting nature of texting during class.

Students who cannot adhere to this policy will be asked to leave the classroom.

Laptops/netbooks/tablets may be used in lecture for word processing purposes ONLY (i.e. no web browsing, social networking, games etc.). Please ensure that any other software is turned off (not minimized) during class. Using any other software is prohibited since research (and past experience) has shown it to be distracting to those students seated in front, beside and behind you. Also remember that prior to class, during breaks etc., other students can view your screen so you should take caution in using other software at these times. Students who cannot adhere to this policy will be asked to leave the class and/or may lose marks at the discretion of the instructor.

Audio recording of lectures is permitted for the purposes of personal studying only. Rebroadcast or distribution in person or via the internet of an audio recording from one of my lectures is only permitted with my written consent. Video recording (and still pictures) of lectures (or lecture material) in whole or in part is not permitted.

If I see a cell phone, laptop, iPad, mp3 player, or any other similar device in your hand or near you during a test or an examination, you will automatically receive a 0.

##Academic Integrity

Please note that students involved in academic dishonesty may receive a zero grade on the course and even notation of academic dishonesty on their transcripts. In this course, academic dishonesty includes copying or use of unauthorized aids in all written work; plagiarism; submission of work generated for another course without prior clearance by the instructor of this course or aiding and abetting another student's dishonesty. Wilfrid Laurier uses software that can check for plagiarism. You will be required to submit your work in electronic form and have it checked for plagiarism
